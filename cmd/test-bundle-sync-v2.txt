Test bundle synchronisation with PR #1100 configuration

This change validates the updated bundle validation triggers after PR #1100,
which removed wasteful bundle validation for component nudge files.

With PR #1100 merged:
- Component nudge PRs (bpfman-agent.txt, bpfman.txt) should NOT trigger any pipelines
- Operator nudge PRs (bpfman-operator.txt) should only trigger bundle validation
- Changes to cmd/ should trigger operator and agent builds as before

Expected flow:
1. This PR triggers operator and agent builds (cmd/ change)
2. Agent completes first, nudges operator component
3. Operator rebuilds ensuring synchronisation
4. Operator nudges bundle via bpfman-operator.txt update
5. Bundle rebuilds with all current component references
6. Release snapshot created with consistent versions

After merge, on-push builds will create new component images, and Renovate
should create nudge PRs that do NOT trigger bundle validation (fixing the
"could not find any PipelineRun" error from PRs #1104 and #1105).
