This is a test file to verify that component builds (operator and agent) trigger
the complete build chain including bundle rebuilds.

When this file is modified and merged to main, it should trigger:
1. bpfman-operator build (via "cmd/***".pathChanged())
2. bpfman-agent build (via "cmd/***".pathChanged())
3. Component images are built and released
4. Image SHA files in hack/konflux/images/ are updated
5. Bundle rebuild triggers (via "hack/konflux/images/***".pathChanged() from PR #1078)
6. Bundle updates with new image references

This validates the complete end-to-end workflow after PR #1078 restored the
hack/konflux/images path trigger in bundle CEL expressions.

Test timestamp: 2025-10-28T11:25:00Z - Part 2: Testing component → image SHA → bundle workflow

Test timestamp: 2025-12-15T11:10:00Z - Testing fixed nudging configuration:
- Agent/daemon now nudge bundle directly (not operator)
- Simple branch annotations prevent competing PRs
- Bundle triggers on all three image files (operator, agent, daemon)
- Expected: Coordinated single-PR updates, consistent snapshots
