This is a test file to verify that component builds (operator and agent) are
triggered correctly when code-related paths change.

When this file is modified and a PR is created, it should trigger both:
- bpfman-operator build pipeline (due to "cmd/***".pathChanged())
- bpfman-agent build pipeline (due to "cmd/***".pathChanged())

This ensures the CEL expressions in the component pipelines are working correctly
and that changes trigger the full build chain: components → image SHAs → bundle.

Test timestamp: 2025-10-28T11:20:00Z - Testing component builds after PR #1078
