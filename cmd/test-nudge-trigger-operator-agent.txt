Test operator and agent build nudge mechanism

This change validates the end-to-end nudging flow for operator and agent
components after the pipeline fixes in PR #1097.

Both operator and agent build from the same source repository (bpfman-operator)
and should trigger builds that cascade through to the bundle.

Expected flow:
1. Operator and agent build in parallel (both triggered by cmd/ change)
2. Agent completes â†’ nudges operator via build-nudges-ref
3. Operator rebuild ensures synchronisation
4. Operator nudges bundle via hack/konflux/images/bpfman-operator.txt
5. Bundle rebuilds with all current component references
6. Release snapshot created with consistent component versions

This validates that the operator synchronisation point prevents race conditions
where agent and operator might finish at different times, ensuring the bundle
always builds with complete, consistent image references.
