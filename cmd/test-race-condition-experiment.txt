Test file to trigger agent and operator builds simultaneously.

Purpose: This change should trigger both agent and operator builds from the same commit,
allowing us to observe the nudging behavior and race condition patterns.

Expected behavior:
1. Agent build triggers (due to cmd/ change)
2. Operator build triggers (due to cmd/ change)
3. Both builds complete at roughly the same time
4. Both attempt to nudge bundle (either directly or via current nudging config)
5. Observe whether race condition occurs in bundle CSV operator mismatch
