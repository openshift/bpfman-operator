Nudge operator and agent zstream builds for release-0.5.8

Trigger fresh operator and agent builds on the release-0.5.8 branch
to ensure the latest zstream images are built and available.

This change in cmd/ will trigger both operator and agent builds,
which will then update their respective image reference files in
hack/konflux/images/, eventually triggering a bundle rebuild.

Expected flow:
1. This PR triggers operator and agent builds
2. Builds complete and update hack/konflux/images/
3. Nudge PRs created for bpfman-operator.txt and bpfman-agent.txt
4. After merge, bundle rebuilds with all current component references
5. Release snapshot created with consistent zstream versions
