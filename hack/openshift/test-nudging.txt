This is a test file to verify that the bundle nudging mechanism works correctly.

When this file is modified and merged to main, it should trigger the bundle build
pipeline due to the CEL expression path condition: "hack/openshift/***".pathChanged()

This ensures that PR #1036's changes to the Tekton pipeline CEL expressions didn't
break the nudging mechanism for bundle builds.
